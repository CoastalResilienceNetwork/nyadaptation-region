Coastal Defense is an application for examining how coastal habitats such as oyster reefs, coral reefs, tidal marshes, mangroves, beach dunes, and seagrass help protect coastal areas by reducing wave energy hitting the shore.  Coastal Defense is part of a collection of "apps" that help identify nature-based solutions.
</p>
<p>
<span class="overviewHeader"><b>Main objectives of the app</b></span></br>
1. Identify areas that may be at risk of coastal erosion and inundation from wave action and storm surge.</br>
2. Examine the role of coastal habitats in attenuating wave height and energy.</br>
3. Determine appropriate adaptation strategies that incorporate green and grey infrastructure trade-offs.

<span class="overviewHeader"><b>Using the app</b></span></br>
To examine a coastal protection scenario, the app will walk you through four main steps in the Inputs window:</br></br>
1. Click to select a region for analysis.</br>
2. Click to set a profile for analysis.</br>
3. Click to set a habitat scenario for analysis.</br>
4. Check the box by each habitat scenario to examine restoration or uncheck to examine current conditions.
</p>
<p>
<span class="overviewHeader"><b>Main assumptions of the model</b></span></br>
The Coastal Defense app is based on a <a href="http://naturalcapitalproject.org/models/coastal_protection.html" target="_blank">coastal protection model</a> from the Natural Capital Project’s Marine Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) program.

It is important to note that this is not a validated predictive model and is meant to provide guidance as an informative and educational tool. This app was created to give a reasonable estimate of the beneficial role that coastal habitats play in protecting shorelines. A 1-D model is used because it’s fast, robust, and gives reasonable results. Currently, the model does not address wave/current interactions. Waves are modeled along a 1-Dimensional transect, and 2-D processes are not considered.
